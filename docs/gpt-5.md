Good — thanks for the error output. Two things are clear from your console:

- The runtime error "this.setupSubmission is not a function" is still being thrown, which stops the rest of the script from running (so projects don't render). That means the running script.js does not contain the safe shim or guard I suggested earlier (or the browser is still loading a cached/old copy).
- The proj-*.jpg 404s mean the image paths referenced by your JSON or fallback don't exist at those locations — that's separate and will only affect images, not the project list itself.

I'll give a minimal, safe change you can paste into your existing script.js to immediately stop the runtime crash, plus a short checklist to verify the updated script is actually being used and how to fix the image 404s.

Patch — make init defensive so missing setupSubmission won't throw
Replace the contactForm.init() implementation in your script.js with the following (this is a minimal, non-invasive change that prevents the "this.setupSubmission is not a function" crash and keeps your existing behavior):

```javascript name=script.js
// --- Replace the contactForm.init() section in your script.js with this block ---
const contactForm = {
    init() {
        // Defensive: setupValidation must run first to attach submit handlers
        this.setupValidation && this.setupValidation();

        // Only call setupSubmission if it exists and is a function
        if (typeof this.setupSubmission === 'function') {
            try {
                this.setupSubmission();
            } catch (err) {
                console.warn('contactForm.setupSubmission threw an error:', err);
            }
        } else {
            // harmless noop - ensures older builds without setupSubmission won't crash
            // console.debug('contactForm.setupSubmission not present; skipping.');
        }
    },

    setupValidation() {
        const form = document.querySelector('#contact-form');
        if (!form) return;

        const inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input[required], textarea[required]');

        inputs.forEach(input => {
            input.addEventListener('blur', () => this.validateField(input));
            input.addEventListener('input', () => this.clearError(input));
        });

        form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => this.handleSubmit(e));
    },

    // If your script already has setupSubmission implemented elsewhere, keep it.
    // Otherwise you can add a safe no-op here:
    setupSubmission() {
        // No-op or additional wiring if needed; present to avoid runtime errors.
    },

    // ...keep the rest of your contactForm methods (validateField, showError, handleSubmit, etc.) unchanged...
};
```

Why this works
- The error happened because contactForm.init() attempted to call a method that did not exist on the object in the running script. The code above checks typeof before calling, so it will not throw. If your full script already defines setupSubmission elsewhere, the above will simply call it; if not, the provided no-op prevents the crash.

Immediate steps to apply and verify
1. Edit script.js
   - Locate the contactForm object and replace its init (and optionally add the no-op setupSubmission shown above).
   - Make sure you preserve the rest of contactForm (validateField, handleSubmit, etc.).

2. Clear cache / force reload
   - Open DevTools → Network and check "Disable cache" then refresh (or use Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R). This ensures the updated script.js is actually loaded instead of a cached copy.

3. Confirm script version loaded
   - Add a short console.log near the top of script.js (temporary) to confirm the file being loaded:
     console.log('script.js loaded — patched at YYYY-MM-DD');

4. Reload and check console
   - The "this.setupSubmission is not a function" error should be gone.
   - If there are still errors, paste the new console output here.

Fixing the proj-*.jpg 404 errors
- The 404s indicate the files referenced by your content/projects.json (or fallback) do not exist at those exact paths on your server.
- Options:
  1) Place the image files into the assets/images/ (or content/images/) folder matching the paths used in your JSON (e.g. assets/images/proj-1.jpg). Verify the exact filenames (case-sensitive on many servers).
  2) Edit content/projects.json and update each project's image property to point to an existing image path or an online placeholder (e.g. https://via.placeholder.com/600x400).
  3) While debugging, change the createProjectCard() image src to a placeholder when project.image is missing:
     const imgSrc = project.image || 'https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=No+image';

Server / fetch reminders
- If you previously opened index.html with file://, fetch() will fail. Serve the site over HTTP locally:
  - Python: python3 -m http.server 8000
  - Node: npx serve .
  Then open http://localhost:8000
- After serving, if content/projects.json still returns 404 in Network tab, confirm the request URL and adjust CONFIG.PROJECTS_DATA path (maybe './content/projects.json' or an absolute path).

If you'd like, I can do one of the following now:
- Create a PR updating script.js in your repo with this fix (I can push the patched script.js and open a PR).
- Or produce the full corrected script.js file for you to drop into the repo (including the earlier JSON-normalization fixes I suggested) — say which you prefer.

Tell me whether you want me to open the PR (and if so I'll proceed), or paste the updated full script.js here for you to replace.

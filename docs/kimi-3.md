The user is encountering a 404 error when trying to install `axe-core-cli`. Let me analyze the search results to understand the issue and provide a solution.

From the search results, I can see:

1. The correct package name is `@axe-core/cli` (with the @ symbol and slash), not `axe-core-cli` 
2. The package is available on npm registry
3. Multiple sources show the correct installation command as `npm install @axe-core/cli`

This is clearly a package naming issue. The user is trying to install `axe-core-cli` but the actual package name is `@axe-core/cli`.

Let me also check if there are any other dependencies that might have similar issues and provide the corrected installation command.

I found the issue! The problem is with the package name - you're trying to install `axe-core-cli` but the correct package name is `@axe-core/cli` (with the @ symbol and scope).

## Corrected Installation Command

```bash
npm install @lhci/cli @axe-core/cli eslint html-validate prettier
```

## What Was Wrong

The package `axe-core-cli` doesn't exist in the npm registry. The correct package is `@axe-core/cli` which is maintained by Deque Systems as part of their axe-core accessibility testing tools.

## Additional Fixes for Your Package.json

Let me also update your `package.json` with the correct dependency names:

```json
{
  "name": "portfolio",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Accessible, performant portfolio website",
  "main": "site/script.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cd site && python3 -m http.server 8080",
    "lint": "eslint site/script.js",
    "lint:fix": "eslint site/script.js --fix",
    "format": "prettier --write \"site/**/*.{js,css,html,json}\"",
    "format:check": "prettier --check \"site/**/*.{js,css,html,json}\"",
    "test:a11y": "@axe-core/cli site/index.html",
    "test:performance": "lhci autorun",
    "build": "npm run lint && npm run format && npm run test:a11y",
    "predeploy": "npm run build && npm run test:performance"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@lhci/cli": "^0.12.0",
    "@axe-core/cli": "^4.8.0",
    "eslint": "^8.57.0",
    "html-validate": "^8.7.4",
    "prettier": "^3.2.5"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can use axe-core CLI for accessibility testing:

```bash
# Test a local file
npx @axe-core/cli site/index.html

# Test with specific WCAG guidelines
npx @axe-core/cli site/index.html --tags wcag2aa

# Test multiple pages
npx @axe-core/cli site/index.html,site/about.html

# Save results to JSON
npx @axe-core/cli site/index.html --save results.json

# Exclude certain elements
npx @axe-core/cli site/index.html --exclude "#advertisement"
```

## Complete Setup Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies correctly
npm install @lhci/cli @axe-core/cli eslint html-validate prettier

# Verify installation
npx @axe-core/cli --help
npx lhci --help
```

This should resolve your 404 error and get your development environment set up properly! The key was using the correct scoped package name `@axe-core/cli` instead of `axe-core-cli`.
